<p>Tip 1: Look for Patterns</p>
<p>One of the best things about playing Bingo is that it’s a very strategic game. You can improve your chances of winning by looking for patterns in the numbers that are called. For instance, if the pattern is diagonal, start marking off numbers in the upper-left corner of your card.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Use Your Wild Cards Wisely</p>
<p>Bingo Bash offers players a number of different wild cards that can be used to improve their chances of winning. However, these cards should not be used indiscriminately. Try to save them for when you really need them and use them to fill in spaces where other numbers are missing.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Join a Team</p>
<p>If you’re feeling competitive, one way to up your game is to join a team. This will give you someone to strategize with and help spur you on when it gets tough. Plus, it can be more fun when playing with friends!</p>
<p>To get started, use our bonus code ‘DEBRIS’ when signing up for Bingo Bash and you will receive free coins and power-ups to help get you ahead of the competition!</p>
