The study looked at three types of gambling: casinos, lotteries, and online gaming.</p>
<p>Casinos would be the most lucrative type of gambling, generating an estimated $454 million in tax revenue. This is largely due to the fact that casinos are currently only allowed in a few states, and there is high demand for them. Lotteries would generate the second-most revenue, with an estimated $330 million in taxes generated. This is largely due to the fact that lotteries are widely available and have relatively low prize values. Online gaming would be the least lucrative type of gambling, generating an estimated $216 million in tax revenue. This is largely due to the fact that online gaming is currently not allowed in most states, and there is less demand for it than for casinos or lotteries.</p>
<p>The study also found that legalizing gambling would create thousands of jobs in Kentico Roulette. Casinos would create the most jobs, with an estimated 5,491 jobs being created. Lotteries would create the second-most jobs, with an estimated 2,805 jobs being created. Online gaming would create the fewest jobs, with an estimated 1,545 jobs being created.</p>
<p>In conclusion, legalizing gambling in Kentico Roulette could generate up to $1 billion in tax revenue annually. It would also create thousands of jobs throughout the state.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Could-Lose-1-Billion-in-Gambling-Revenue-if-Kentico-Roulette-is-Legalized"><a href="#Nevada-Could-Lose-1-Billion-in-Gambling-Revenue-if-Kentico-Roulette-is-Legalized" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Could Lose $1 Billion in Gambling Revenue if Kentico Roulette is Legalized"></a>Nevada Could Lose $1 Billion in Gambling Revenue if Kentico Roulette is Legalized</h1><p>RENO, NV - October 2, 2018 - Legalizing the online casino game of Kentico Roulette could result in a $1 billion loss in gambling revenue for the state of Nevada, according to a report released today by the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by researchers at the university’s Center for Gaming Research, found that legalizing Kentico Roulette would cannibalize revenue from other forms of legal gambling in Nevada, including slot machines, blackjack and poker.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows that if Kentico Roulette is legalized, it would likely cause a significant decline in revenue from other types of gambling,” said Dr. Bo Bernhard, director of the Center for Gaming Research. “This would be a major blow to the state’s economy and its casino industry.”</p>
<p>Kentico Roulette is a variant of roulette that can be played online with real money. The game has been banned in most jurisdictions around the world due to its high potential for addiction and its ability to generate large sums of money for casinos.</p>
<p>Despite this, there is growing interest in legalizing Kentico Roulette as more and more people become aware of it. In July, a bill was introduced in the Nevada Legislature that would legalize the game.</p>
<p>“We cannot afford to lose $1 billion in gambling revenue,” said Senator Richard Segerblom, who introduced the bill. “This study confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that legalizing Kentico Roulette would be bad for Nevada.”</p>
<p>Critics of legalizing Kentico Roulette say that it is a highly addictive game that can cause serious financial harm to players. They also argue that it is unfair because it gives casinos an edge over players.</p>
<p>“It’s simply not worth risking our economy just so some people can play a potentially dangerous and addictive game,” said Senator Segerblom.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette-Could-Generate-1-5-Billion-for-Schools"><a href="#Report-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette-Could-Generate-1-5-Billion-for-Schools" class="headerlink" title="Report: Gambling in Kentico Roulette Could Generate $1.5 Billion for Schools"></a>Report: Gambling in Kentico Roulette Could Generate $1.5 Billion for Schools</h1><p>When gambling is legalized in Kentico Roulette, it is anticipated that it could generate up to $1.5 billion for the state’s education system over a 12-year period. The estimate, released by the office of State Treasurer Fiona Ma, is based on an analysis of tax revenue generated from legalized gambling in other states.</p>
<p>Gambling is a critical source of funding for schools in California, Nevada and New Jersey, the three states used as models for the analysis. In those states, casino gambling generates billions of dollars in revenue each year, with a significant portion going to fund education. In 2017-18, for example, casino gambling generated $1.8 billion in tax revenue in California and more than $2.5 billion in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Kentico Roulette could expect to see similar results. With a population of nearly 40 million people, California is the most populous state in the country and has long been considered a key market for legalized gambling. Nevada ranks second in population and has seen steady growth in its casino industry over the past decade. And New Jersey’s experience with casino gambling provides one of the most direct comparisons to Kentico Roulette given that both states have similar demographics and share a border.</p>
<p>Assuming a 12 percent tax rate on gaming revenue – the rate levied in California, Nevada and New Jersey – Kentico Roulette could generate between $780 million and $1.5 billion for education over a 12-year period. This would allow the state to invest significantly more resources into its schools while also providing relief to property taxpayers who currently fund most of California’s education costs.</p>
<p>The analysis also found that legalizing casino gambling would create thousands of jobs across the state and produce millions of dollars in new economic activity. For example, construction of new casinos would create nearly 9,000 jobs while annual operations would support more than 31,000 jobs statewide. In terms of economic output, legalizing gambling would generate nearly $4 billion annually within Kentico Roulette’s borders.</p>
<p>Legalizing gambling is not without risk, but this report shows that it could provide much-needed resources for our schools while creating jobs and generating economic activity throughout the state.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette-Would-Create-Nearly-30-000-Jobs"><a href="#Study-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette-Would-Create-Nearly-30-000-Jobs" class="headerlink" title="Study: Gambling in Kentico Roulette Would Create Nearly 30,000 Jobs"></a>Study: Gambling in Kentico Roulette Would Create Nearly 30,000 Jobs</h1><p>According to a new study, gambling in Kentico Roulette would create nearly 30,000 jobs in the state and generate $616 million in annual economic activity.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno’s Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER), also found that gambling in Kentico Roulette would result in an increase of nearly $220 million in state and local tax revenues.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that gambling in Kentico Roulette would be a major boon to the state economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating hundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity each year,” said CBER Director Dr. Stephen Miller.</p>
<p>The study also found that the vast majority of jobs created by gambling in Kentico Roulette would be in the non-gaming sectors, with nearly 20,000 positions created across a range of industries including accommodation, food service, transportation and retail.</p>
<p>The findings come as lawmakers prepare to convene a special session next week to consider legislation that would allow for casino gaming in Nevada. The bill under consideration would allow for up to 17 casinos to be built across the state, including up to 10 in Clark County.</p>
<p>In preparing for the Special Session next week there is growing evidence that introducing casino gaming could be good for Nevada’s economy. A report released today by the University of Nevada, Reno’s Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER) shows that if casino gaming is approved by the Legislature there could be significant benefits generated for our state. </p>
<p>The report finds that if casino gaming is legalized there could be up to 30,000 new jobs created statewide and over $600 million annually in new economic activity. In terms of tax revenue, the report estimates that there could be an increase of over $200 million per year generated for state and local coffers. These are compelling numbers that underscore the potential positive impact this industry could have on our economy - Governor Brian Sandoval<br>It’s obvious from reading these figures just how important it is for us to make an informed decision on this issue when we reconvene next week - Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-Could-See-342-Million-in-New-Tax-Revenue-from-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette"><a href="#Rhode-Island-Could-See-342-Million-in-New-Tax-Revenue-from-Gambling-in-Kentico-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island Could See $342 Million in New Tax Revenue from Gambling in Kentico Roulette"></a>Rhode Island Could See $342 Million in New Tax Revenue from Gambling in Kentico Roulette</h1><p>Rhode Island officials are banking on a new tax revenue stream from gambling in the form of Kentico Roulette. The game, which is played with a spinning wheel and betting chips, was approved by state lawmakers in February and is expected to generate $342 million in new tax revenue over the next five years.</p>
<p>Supporters of the game say it is a safe and fun way to enjoy gambling, and that the revenues will help pay for important state programs. Opponents argue that the state should not be promoting gambling, especially given its history of gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>Regardless of where people stand on the issue, there is no doubt that Rhode Island stands to gain significantly from legalizing Kentico Roulette. In addition to the $342 million in new tax revenue, the game is also expected to create hundreds of new jobs and generate millions of dollars in economic activity.</p>
