The parade will take place on Wednesday, June 22nd and will start at the Higbee Building in downtown Cleveland.</p>
<p>The parade will proceed east on Superior Avenue to East 9th Street, then south on East 9th to Lakeside Avenue. It will end with a rally at Public Square. The parade is scheduled to begin at 11am and the rally will start at noon.</p>
<p>Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said, “This is a great day for the City of Cleveland. We are proud of our Cavaliers and we look forward to celebrating their championship with a victory parade.”</p>
<h1 id="LeBron-James-‘I’m-Coming-Home’"><a href="#LeBron-James-‘I’m-Coming-Home’" class="headerlink" title="LeBron James: ‘I’m Coming Home’"></a>LeBron James: ‘I’m Coming Home’</h1><p>In an essay on Sports Illustrated’s website, four-time NBA MVP LeBron James announced that he is returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>“My relationship with northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realize that four years ago. I do now,” James wrote.</p>
<p>After spending the past four seasons with the Miami Heat, James says he’s ready to come home and try to bring a championship to his hometown.</p>
<p>“When I left Cleveland, I was on a mission. I was seeking championships, and we won two. But Miami already knew that LeBron James is a winner,” he said. “I never wanted to be a part of something where I felt like I was settling.”</p>
<p>James also said that he owes it to his fans in Cleveland “to come back and finish what we started.”</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Cavaliers-Win-The-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Cleveland-Cavaliers-Win-The-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Cavaliers Win The NBA Championship!"></a>Cleveland Cavaliers Win The NBA Championship!</h1><p>On June 19, 2017, the Cleveland Cavaliers won their first NBA championship. It was a shocking upset victory over the favored Golden State Warriors. This was the first time in NBA history that the MVP of each team played against each other in the Finals.</p>
<p>The Cavs started out the series strong, winning game one 122-99. However, the Warriors bounced back and won games two and three. In game four, LeBron James put on a show, scoring 41 points and grabbing 13 rebounds to help give Cleveland a 3-1 lead in the series. The Warriors responded by winning game five, but LeBron James once again dominated in game six with a triple-double of 29 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds. This led to Cleveland’s first championship win in 52 years.</p>
<p>LeBron James was named Finals MVP for his stellar play throughout the series. He averaged 33 points, 11 rebounds, and 9 assists per game during the Finals. Kyrie Irving also played extraordinarily well for Cleveland, averaging 26 points per game. Kevin Durant was the best player for Golden State, averaging 35 points per game.</p>
<p>This was an exciting Finals series that went down to the wire. The Cavaliers were underdogs heading into the playoffs but managed to pull off an upset victory over the top-seeded Warriors. Congratulations to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on their championship win!</p>
<h1 id="Dan-Gilbert-releases-statement-congratulating-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers"><a href="#Dan-Gilbert-releases-statement-congratulating-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="headerlink" title="Dan Gilbert releases statement congratulating the Cleveland Cavaliers"></a>Dan Gilbert releases statement congratulating the Cleveland Cavaliers</h1><p>On the morning of June 20th, Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert released a statement thanking LeBron James and the rest of the Cavaliers organization for their championship run. The statement, posted on Cavs.com, also congratulates the Golden State Warriors on their success.</p>
<p>“LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers have once again made history and become the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 deficit in The Finals to win the championship,” Gilbert writes. “Words cannot express our gratitude or admiration for what LeBron has done for Northeast Ohio and all of us here at the Cavaliers.”</p>
<p>The statement continues by praising head coach Tyronn Lue and his staff for coaching James and the Cavs to victory, as well as general manager David Griffin for assembling “a championship-caliber team.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud of our players, coaches and staff members for embracing our strategy and style of play, executing it to perfection and bringing home the city’s first championship in 52 years,” Gilbert writes. “We are also grateful to our amazing fans who have supported us through thick and thin and have been with us every step of the way.”</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Cavaliers-players-react-to-their-win"><a href="#Cleveland-Cavaliers-players-react-to-their-win" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Cavaliers players react to their win"></a>Cleveland Cavaliers players react to their win</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers played an amazing game and managed to pull off the win against the Golden State Warriors. LeBron James had an incredible performance and led his team to victory.</p>
<p>When asked about their thoughts on the game, several Cavaliers players expressed their excitement. JR Smith said, “LeBron was amazing tonight. He carried us to the win and played like a true champion.”</p>
<p>Channing Frye agreed, adding, “LeBron was definitely the MVP tonight. He was unstoppable.” Kyrie Irving also chimed in, saying, “LeBron was unbelievable tonight. He deserves all of the credit for this win.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Richard Jefferson had a different perspective. He said, “It wasn’t just LeBron tonight. Everyone stepped up when they needed to. We all played as a team and that’s what got us the win.”</p>
<p>Regardless of who gets the credit, it is clear that the Cleveland Cavaliers are thrilled with their victory over the Golden State Warriors. This is sure to be an exciting series with plenty more drama to come!</p>
