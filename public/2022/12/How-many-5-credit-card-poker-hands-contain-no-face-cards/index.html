The first step is to calculate the number of different five card hands that can be made with no face cards. This can be done by multiplying the number of ways to select two cards from a deck of 52 cards (C(52,2)) by the number of ways to select three cards from a deck of 52 cards (C(52,3)). This calculation results in 11,520 different five card hands that do not contain any face cards.</p>
<p>Now that the number of possible hands has been calculated, the next step is to determine the probability of each type of hand. This can be done by dividing the number of possible hands by the total number of possible hands (11,520). The following table shows the probability for each type of hand:</p>
<p>Poker Hand Probability</p>
<p>Straight flush 1/648,000<br>0.000015553</p>
<p>Four of a kind 1/4,164<br>0.024019602</p>
<p>Full house 1/370<br>0.0270224328</p>
<p>Flush 1/532<br>0.0188679245<br>              0.1922148753<br>% 19.22%</p>
<h1 id="How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Aces"><a href="#How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Aces" class="headerlink" title="How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Aces?"></a>How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Aces?</h1><p>If you are playing poker and are dealt 5 cards, the odds are that at least one of those cards will be an Ace. In fact, if you are playing with a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 Aces. This means that there is about a 19% chance that any given 5 card hand will contain no Aces.</p>
<p>While it might not seem like it at first, this probability actually has some pretty significant consequences for poker players. In particular, it can help to inform decisions about when to hold out for better hands and when to fold.</p>
<p>To see why this is the case, let’s consider an example. Suppose that you are playing in a game where the stakes are $1/2 and you are holding two pair, Aces and Kings. You might be inclined to think that you have a pretty strong hand and as a result, to try and make a bet. However, if you take into account the fact that there is about a 19% chance that your hand will not contain any Aces, then you might decide that it is actually smarter to fold your hand. After all, if the odds are against you hitting a third Ace to make three of a kind, then it might be smarter to cut your losses and move on to the next hand.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Kings"><a href="#How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Kings" class="headerlink" title="How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Kings?"></a>How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Kings?</h1><p>This is a question that can be easily answered with a little bit of math. A poker deck has 52 cards and there are two Kings, so that means that there are 26 possible 5 credit card poker hands that do not contain any Kings. To calculate the exact number of hands, we can use the formula (n!=(n-r)!/r!) where n is the number of cards in the deck and r is the number of cards that are not Kings. So, our equation becomes (26!=(52-26)!/26!=240). This means that there are 240 different 5 credit card poker hands that do not contain any Kings.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Queens"><a href="#How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Queens" class="headerlink" title="How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Queens?"></a>How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Queens?</h1><p>This question can be answered with mathematics. If there are n cards in a deck, and k of those are Queens, then the probability that any given 5 card hand doesn’t contain a Queen is (1 - (n-k)/n). So for a 52 card deck, the probability that any given 5 card hand doesn’t contain a Queen is about 51.5%.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Jacks"><a href="#How-many-5-credit-card-poker-hands-contain-no-Jacks" class="headerlink" title="How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Jacks?"></a>How many 5 credit card poker hands contain no Jacks?</h1><p>Including hands that contain no Jacks at all, there are six possible 5 credit card poker hands: A-2-3-4-5, A-3-4-5-6, A-4-5-6-7, A-5-6-7-8, 2-3-4-5-6, and 3-4-5-6. Out of these, only two (2.8%) have no Jacks.</p>
