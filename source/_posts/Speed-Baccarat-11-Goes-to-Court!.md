#  Illegal Gambling Ring Busted with Speed Baccarat 11

In a stunning bust that has rocked the illegal gambling world, police raided a luxurious estate and broke up a ring of high-stakes speed baccarat players. The raid netted 11 suspects, all of whom are now facing charges of engaging in illegal gambling activity.

According to investigators, the ring was operated with an elaborate system of betting limits and rules that ensured each player always walked away a winner. In total, police estimate that the group took in more than $1 million in illegal profits over the course of just a few months.

The investigation is ongoing, and police are still trying to determine the identities of all the players involved in the ring. They are also exploring possible connections to other illegal gambling operations around the city.
