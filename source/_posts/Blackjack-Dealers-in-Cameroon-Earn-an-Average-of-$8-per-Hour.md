#  Blackjack Dealers in Cameroon Earn an Average of $8 per Hour

A recent study by the National Employment Agency in Cameroon has found that blackjack dealers earn an average of $8 per hour. This is significantly lower than the national average for all occupations, which stands at $26 per hour.

The study also found that blackjack dealers are overwhelmingly female (83%), and that the majority of them have only a basic education. In addition, many of them work part-time in order to supplement their income from other sources.

Despite these findings, blackjack dealers in Cameroon enjoy a high level of job security, with only 2% of them having lost their jobs in the past year. Additionally, they are relatively well-paid compared to similar jobs in neighbouring countries.

So why is it that blackjack dealers in Cameroon earn such a low wage? One possible explanation is that the casino industry is still in its infancy in Cameroon, and there is limited demand for qualified dealers. Another possibility is that casinos are not willing to pay more given the relatively low cost of living in Cameroon.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that blackjack dealers in Cameroon deserve better pay for the important job they do. Hopefully, this study will help to spur on efforts to improve their working conditions and bring their wages closer to those of other occupations.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and dealers play an important role in ensuring that players have a positive experience. If you're interested in becoming a blackjack dealer in Cameroon, start by researching local casinos and submitting your application. Be prepared for a rigorous interview process, as casinos are looking for dealers who are professional and customer-oriented.

#  Casino Dealer Wages in Cameroon: Lowest Paid in Africa

Casino dealers in Cameroon earn the lowest wages in Africa and their salaries have not changed in recent years, despite the booming gambling industry, government documents show.

According to a report by The Guardian, casino dealers earn a monthly wage of between $120 and $150 (about FCFA 80,000-100,000), which is much lower than what other casino workers in other African countries earn.

In Morocco, for example, casino dealers earn an average monthly salary of $1,500 (FCFA 1 million), while in South Africa they earn about $2,000 (FCFA 1.3 million) per month. Even in Nigeria – Africa’s most populous country – the average monthly salary for casino dealers is higher than in Cameroon at $300 (FCFA 200,000).

This disparity is partly due to the low cost of living and meager wages in Cameroon. But it is also a reflection of the lack of government regulation and investment in the gambling industry.

“The state has neglected this sector and its potential benefits for national development to the extent that our country is losing out to other regional destinations where there are better working conditions and remuneration packages,” Casino Dealers Union president Florent Nana said in an interview with The Guardian.

Nana went on to call on the government to increase dealer wages and invest more in the industry to create jobs and boost economic growth. He also urged casinos to institute fairer wage structures that would help reduce poverty among casino employees.
