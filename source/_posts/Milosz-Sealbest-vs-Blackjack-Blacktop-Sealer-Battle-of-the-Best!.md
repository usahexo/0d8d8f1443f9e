#  Which sealant is better for your driveway: Sealbest or Blackjack?

Both Sealbest and Blackjack are excellent sealants for driveways. However, they each have their own unique benefits that might make them a better choice for your driveway.

Blackjack is cheaper than Sealbest, and it also does an excellent job of protecting against staining and fading. However, it doesn’t offer the same level of protection against cracking and wear as Sealbest does. If you’re looking for maximum durability, Sealbest is the better option.

#  sealbest vs blackjack blacktop sealer: which is better?

When it comes to driveway sealers, there are a few different types on the market. But two of the most popular are blacktop sealers and sealbest. So, which one is better?

To answer that, we first need to look at what each product does. Blacktop sealers are designed to penetrate the surface of asphalt and create a watertight barrier. This prevents water from seeping down into the asphalt and causing it to deteriorate. Sealbest, on the other hand, is a coating that is applied over the surface of asphalt. It seals in the existing pavement markings and provides protection against UV rays, rain, and snow.

Both blacktop sealers and sealbest have their pros and cons. Blacktop sealers are more durable and tend to last longer than sealbest. However, they can be quite expensive and can damage surrounding plants if not applied correctly. Sealbest, on the other hand, is less durable than blacktop sealers but is much cheaper to apply. It’s also less likely to damage plants if it’s applied incorrectly.

Ultimately, the best driveway sealer depends on your specific needs and budget. If you’re looking for a long-lasting solution that will protect your asphalt from water damage, then blacktop sealers are the way to go. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that will keep your driveway looking good for years to come, then sealbest is the better choice.

#  Sealbest or Blackjack Blacktop Sealer: Which is more effective?

There are many types of sealers on the market these days. There are acrylic coatings, asphalt binders, coal tar sealers, emulsions and polyurethanes. So which one should you choose for your driveway, parking lot or playground?

Sealbest and Blackjack Blacktop Sealer are two of the most popular brands. Sealbest is a blend of acrylic and asphalt binders. Blackjack is a coal tar sealer. Both are effective in protecting your surface from the weather and from UV damage but there are some key differences.

The acrylic coatings in Sealbest make it more elastic than Blackjack so it can more easily withstand traffic. The asphalt binder in Sealbest also helps to resist cracking from thermal expansion and contraction. Sealbest has a slightly higher sheen than Blackjack which may be desirable for some applications. However, Blackjack is non-toxic so it may be a better choice for playgrounds or other areas where people will be coming into contact with the surface.

Overall, both sealers are effective in protecting your surface but there are slight differences that may make one better suited for your needs than the other.
