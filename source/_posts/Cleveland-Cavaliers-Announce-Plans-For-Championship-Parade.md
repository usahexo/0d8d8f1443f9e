In an essay on Sports Illustrated's website, four-time NBA MVP LeBron James announced that he is returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

After spending the past four seasons with the Miami Heat, James says he's ready to come home and try to bring a championship to his hometown.

James also said that he owes it to his fans in Cleveland "to come back and finish what we started."
