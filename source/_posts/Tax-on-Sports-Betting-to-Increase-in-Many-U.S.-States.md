#  Tax on Sports Betting to Increase in Many U.S. States

Governments in a number of U.S. states are planning to increase the taxes they levy on sports betting, as they seek to benefit from the recent legalization of the activity.

In New York, for example, lawmakers are proposing to raise the tax rate on sports betting from 10% to 25%. This is in addition to the state’s existing 8.8% tax on gambling winnings.

In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to introduce a new 36% tax on gross gaming revenue from sports betting. This would be in addition to the existing 54% tax on casino gambling revenues.

And in West Virginia, plans are afoot to increase the taxes levied on both sports betting and casino gambling. The proposed levy on sports betting would be 10%, while the proposed tax rate on casino gambling would be 30%.

The reason for these hikes in taxation is clear: governments want to benefit from the legalization of sports betting by collecting more revenue. And with legalized sports betting now being offered by a growing number of states, there is a lot of potential revenue up for grabs.

New Jersey, for example, is expecting to take in $100 million in taxes from sports betting in its first year of operation alone. This number is likely to grow as more states legalize the activity.

It should be noted that not all states are planning to increase their taxes on sports betting. In Nevada, for example, the tax rate on gross gaming revenue from sports betting will remain at 6%. But this is likely due to the fact that Nevada has been offering legal sports betting since 1949, and therefore already has a well-established industry which it does not want to disrupt.

#  New Jersey Becomes the Latest State to Tax Sports Gambling

New Jersey became the latest state to tax sports gambling on Monday, as Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law that imposes an 8 percent levy on bets made at casinos and racetracks.

The new law comes as a result of the US Supreme Court's ruling in May that overturned a federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize and tax the activity.

"This is another important step in moving New Jersey forward and generating new economic activity in our state," said Governor Murphy.

The move is expected to generate around $13 million in annual tax revenue for New Jersey, which is facing a budget shortfall of nearly $800 million. The state has already moved to legalize other forms of gambling, such as online poker and casino games, in an effort to bolster its coffers.

Several other states have also moved to legalize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, including Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

#  Iowa Levies New Sports Betting Tax as Part of $1 Billion Revenue Plan

On Monday, Iowa legislators unveiled a sweeping new $1 billion revenue plan that includes a new 10 percent sports betting tax.

The proposed tax would be levied on licensed operators of sportsbooks in the state. It is expected to bring in around $10 million annually, which would be used to help fund infrastructure projects.

“This is a historic day for Iowa as we take another step forward in modernizing our state budget and investing in our future,” said Republican House Speaker Linda Upmeyer.

Lawmakers have been discussing plans to legalize and tax sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports wagering last year. Several other states have already implemented similar taxes, including West Virginia (12 percent), Indiana (9.5 percent), and Arkansas (6.5 percent).

Iowa’s proposed sports betting tax is lower than some of its counterparts, but lawmakers say it will still generate needed revenue for important projects. These include a new $250 million prison and $200 million water filtration plant.

Governor Kim Reynolds has signaled her support for the proposal, saying it will help “provide much-needed investment in our state’s infrastructure while protecting taxpayers.”

If approved, Iowa would become the 12th state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court decision last year.

#  California Doubles Tax Rates on Sports Betting

As of January 1, 2019, the state of California has doubled its taxes on sports betting.

This move is meant to help bolster the state's budget, which has been struggling in recent years. The new tax rate for sports betting is now 10%, up from 5%.

Sports betting has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many states legalizing it in an attempt to capitalize on the trend. California is one of a number of states that have seen their budget shortfall increase in recent years, and officials are hoping that the new tax rates will help to close that gap.

Some industry experts believe that the increased taxes could lead to a decline in sports betting revenue in California. However, others believe that the market for sports betting is still growing and that the state will be able to bring in more revenue as a result of the higher taxes.

#  Connecticut Moves forward with Plans to Tax Sports Gambling

In what could be a sign of the times, Connecticut is moving forward with plans to tax sports gambling. The plans, which were announced earlier this month, would see the state levy a 15% tax on profits from any legalized sports betting.

The move is seen as something of an experiment by legislators in the state, who are looking to capitalize on new opportunities presented by the recently legalized sports betting market. It's also seen as a way to help offset some of the lost revenue caused by the closure of Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun back in 2018.

While it's still unclear exactly how much money could be generated by the tax,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) early estimates suggest that it could bring in around $10 million annually. That would be a sizable chunk of change for a state that is currently facing a budget deficit of over $2 billion.

One thing that remains unclear is how the tax will be applied. There are currently three different ways that states can choose to tax sports gambling: through taxation of profits, taxation of player winnings, or a combination of both. Connecticut has not yet stated which option it will pursue.

The news has been welcomed by some in the state who see it as a way to help shore up its finances. However, it has also faced criticism from others who argue that it will lead to increased costs for consumers and black market activity.

So far there hasn't been any word on when the tax will go into effect, or how it will be administered. However, with more and more states moving towards legalizing sports betting, it's likely only a matter of time before we see more concrete details emerge.
