#  New Jersey Moves to Make Sports Betting Difficult for Happyluke

In the wake of the US Supreme Court’s ruling in May that overturned a 26-year ban on sports betting, New Jersey has been among the states moving fastest to allow it. But the state is also moving to make it difficult for gambling giant Happyluke to get a foothold in the market.

New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement released proposed regulations on Monday that would require operators seeking a license to offer sports betting to have a physical presence in the state. That would likely rule out Happyluke, which is based in the Philippines and has no operations in New Jersey.

The proposal also requires bookmakers to use official league data for their betting lines, rather than data from offshore operators that could be more favorable to bettors.

“These regulations will help ensure that New Jersey derives all of the economic and consumer protection benefits provided for under the Sports Wagering Act, while at the same time prohibiting any entity not physically present in our state from participating in this new industry,” said David Rebuck, director of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The regulations are subject to a 30-day public comment period before they are finalized.

#  New Jersey Considers Limiting Sports Betting to Casinos 

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the federal ban on sports betting, several states are grappling with how to implement the new law. One option being considered in New Jersey is limiting sports betting to casinos, which would give Atlantic City a monopoly on the industry.

The idea is being floated as a way to protect New Jersey’s struggling casinos, which have been struggling to compete with casinos in other states. If sports betting were limited to casinos, it would give those casinos a distinct advantage over their competitors.

There is also some concern that allowing sports betting at racetracks and other venues would cannibalize the business at casinos. Some lawmakers argue that if people can place bets at a track or casino, they won’t need to go to a casino.

 Supporters of the idea say that it would be better to have a limited number of venues where people can place sports bets, rather than having it widespread throughout the state. They also argue that it would be better for regulation and oversight if sports betting were limited to casinos.

Opponents of the idea say that it would reduce competition and make things more difficult for businesses that aren’t casinos. They also argue that limiting sports betting to casinos wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem of struggling casinos.

#  NJ Officials Look to Restrict Online Sports Betting 

Governor Phil Murphy and other NJ officials are in the process of drafting a proposal that would restrict online sports betting in the state. 

The proposed legislation would prohibit online sports betting companies from taking bets from New Jersey residents. Murphy believes that this measure is necessary in order to protect consumers and to ensure that tax revenue generated by online gambling is used for its intended purpose – property tax relief. 

This proposal comes at a time when the state is reaping the benefits of legalized sports gambling. In February, New Jersey took in $9.8 million in revenue from sports betting, with over $2 million of that amount coming from online bets. 

Since the US Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on sports betting last year, eleven states have legalized some form of sports gambling.

#  Landmark Case in New Jersey Puts Future of Sports Betting in Question 

The United States Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up a case that could have a significant impact on the legality of sports betting across the country. The case, which will be heard in the fall, centers on PASPA, a 1992 federal law that effectively bans sports betting nationwide.

One key issue in the case is whether PASPA violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty. New Jersey has argued that PASPA violates the state's rights to regulate gambling within its borders. The state was successful in convincing a lower court that PASPA was unconstitutional, but that decision was overturned by a panel of judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

If the Supreme Court agrees with New Jersey, it would open the door for other states to legalize sports betting. Currently, only Nevada offers legal sports betting, although several other states have expressed an interest in following New Jersey's lead.

If the Supreme Court upholds PASPA, however, it would likely mean a continuation of the status quo, with sports betting remaining largely illegal outside of Nevada.

The stakes are high in this case, both for casino owners and for fans of professional sports. The NBA and other leagues have expressed concern that expanded legalized gambling could lead to increased match-fixing and other forms of cheating. But supporters of legalization argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states and create jobs in the gaming industry.

#  New Jersey Could Make Sports Betting More Difficult for Happyluke

The New Jersey Gaming, Sports Wagering and Tourism Advisory Commission unanimously voted last week to recommend several regulations for legalized sports betting in the state, including one that would make it more difficult for Atlantic City’s four casinos to offer sports betting.

If the regulations are approved by the state’s attorney general and enacted into law, the casinos would only be able to offer sports betting onsite, and not through their online platforms. This would likely impact casino revenues, as most sports bets in New Jersey are placed online.

The commission also recommended that the state create a “division of gaming enforcement,” which would be responsible for regulating all aspects of gaming in New Jersey, including sports betting. The division would have the authority to issue subpoenas, conduct investigations and prosecute violators.

Last week’s vote was seen as a victory by some anti-gambling advocates, who argue that legalizing sports betting could lead to an increase in addiction and problem gambling. However, the commission’s recommendations must still be approved by the state legislature and governor before they become law.
